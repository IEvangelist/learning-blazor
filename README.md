Take advantage of your C# skills to build UI components and client-side experiences with .NET. With this practical guide, you'll learn how to use Blazor WebAssembly to develop next-generation web experiences. Built on top of ASP.NET Core, Blazor represents the future of .NET single-page applications (SPA) investments. |

## This app is deployed to: https://webassemblyof.net

The app is a Blazor WebAssembly app, deployed to Azure as a Static Web app. It targets .NET 6, and it's packed full of C# 10 features.
